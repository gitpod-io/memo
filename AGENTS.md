# AGENTS.md

This repository is entirely agent-generated. No human writes code here.

## Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript (strict), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Supabase: database (PostgreSQL), auth, realtime — via `@supabase/supabase-js`
- Sentry (`@sentry/nextjs`) for error tracking
- Vitest for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E
- Deployed on Vercel, domain: software-factory.dev

## Project Structure

```
src/app/           → Pages and API routes (App Router)
src/components/    → Reusable UI components (one per file, named exports)
src/components/ui/ → shadcn/ui components (do not edit)
src/lib/           → Utilities, types, constants
src/lib/supabase/  → Supabase clients (client.ts, server.ts, proxy.ts)
supabase/migrations/ → Database migrations
.agents/           → Agent knowledge base (architecture, conventions, design)
.ona/              → Automation definitions and skills
docs/              → Product spec, decisions
metrics/           → Daily/weekly metrics snapshots
```

## Rules

- Server components by default. `"use client"` only for hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs.
- No `any`. No `@ts-ignore`. No `as` casts unless unavoidable (comment why).
- No ORMs — use `@supabase/supabase-js` for all database operations.
- No custom CSS — Tailwind utility classes only.
- Check shadcn/ui before building custom components.
- Named exports only. No default exports.
- Conventional commits: `feat|fix|chore|docs|test|refactor(scope): description`
- PRs with type `feat` or `fix` must reference an issue: `Closes #N`. Chore PRs (metrics, docs, deps) do not require an issue.
- **Issue-first workflow:** Before creating a `feat` or `fix` PR, create a GitHub issue first (or find an existing one). Label it `status:in-progress` immediately. Add `Closes #N` to the PR description. This prevents the PR Reviewer from blocking the merge.
- **Exception — `ona-user` PRs:** PRs created via interactive Ona sessions (user prompts) may use the `ona-user` label instead of linking an issue. The PR Reviewer will merge these without requiring `Closes #N`.
- Database changes require a migration: `npx supabase migration new <name>`
- Environment variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix only for browser-safe values.

## Testing

- Unit tests (Vitest): utility functions, non-trivial logic, API route handlers
- Integration tests (Vitest): API routes with mocked Supabase
- E2E tests (Playwright): interactive features, critical user flows, new pages
- Static analysis tests (Vitest): design spec compliance checks on source code
- Skip tests for trivial layout-only components

### When to write E2E tests

- Drag-and-drop (editor blocks, sidebar pages)
- Floating UI (toolbars, menus, popovers that appear/disappear based on user action)
- Multi-step flows (auth, page creation, workspace switching)
- Any feature where the bug would only manifest in a real browser (not jsdom)

### When unit tests are sufficient

- Pure functions and utilities
- API route handlers (mock Supabase)
- Data transformations (markdown conversion, tree building)
- Component rendering without complex interaction

### E2E test location

- Config: `playwright.config.ts`
- Tests: `e2e/` directory
- Auth fixture: `e2e/fixtures/auth.ts` — provides `authenticatedPage` for tests needing login
- Authenticated tests require `TEST_USER_EMAIL` and `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` env vars

### Running tests

- Run before pushing: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm test:e2e`

## Backlog

Issues use labels for status, priority, and flags:
- Status: `status:backlog`, `status:in-progress`, `status:in-review`, `status:done`
- Priority: `priority:1` (foundation), `priority:2` (features), `priority:3` (polish)
- Type: `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `chore`, `performance`
- Flag: `needs-human` — excludes the issue from automation queues until a human responds. The Needs-Human Requeue automation removes this label when new comments are detected, and the Feature Planner re-triages on its next run.
- Flag: `ona-user` — applied to PRs created via interactive Ona sessions. The PR Reviewer merges these without requiring a linked issue.
- Query: `gh issue list --label "status:backlog" --label "priority:1" --state open`

Label lifecycle: `status:backlog` → `status:in-progress` → `status:in-review` → `status:done`

### Label rules to avoid automation conflicts

- `status:backlog` — **only** for issues you want automations (Feature Builder, Bug Fixer) to pick up. These automations poll for `status:backlog` issues on a cron schedule.
- `status:in-progress` — use when creating an issue for work you are already doing. This prevents automations from picking it up.
- Never create an issue with `status:backlog` if you intend to work on it yourself — use `status:in-progress` instead.

### How to request a feature or improvement

1. Create a GitHub Issue using the feature or bug template.
2. The Feature Planner triages unlabeled issues on its next manual run.
3. If detail is sufficient, labels are added and the issue enters the automation queue.
4. If detail is insufficient, `needs-human` is added with specific questions — respond to them and the automation will re-queue the issue.

### Automation development loop

These automations work together to implement features and fix bugs autonomously:

| Automation | Trigger | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Feature Planner | Manual | Triages unlabeled issues, decomposes specs into issues |
| Feature Builder | Cron (30 min) | Implements features/enhancements from backlog |
| Bug Fixer | Cron (30 min) | Implements bug fixes from backlog |
| PR Reviewer | Cron (15 min) | Reviews and merges PRs |
| Incident Responder | Cron (15 min) | Triages Sentry errors into bug issues |
| Post-Merge Verifier | On PR merge | Smoke-tests production after merge |
| UI Verifier | On PR merge | Checks design spec compliance |
| Performance Monitor | Weekly | Checks latency, errors, build size |
| Needs-Human Requeue | Cron (30 min) | Re-queues issues after user responds |

## Where to Find Details

- Architecture and data flow: `.agents/architecture.md`
- Design spec (colors, typography, spacing, components, interactions): `.agents/design.md`
- Coding patterns and conventions: `.agents/conventions.md`
- Quality status per domain: `.agents/quality.md`
- Product specification: `docs/product-spec.md`

## Next.js

Before any Next.js work, find and read the relevant doc in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Your training data is outdated — the docs are the source of truth.

## Do NOT

- Install deps without checking if an existing one covers the need
- Create files outside the established directory structure
- Commit `.env`, `node_modules/`, `.next/`
- Leave TODO comments — implement it or note in the PR description
- Modify files unrelated to the current task
- Silently exit on failure — always report visibly (issue comment, PR comment, or new bug issue)
